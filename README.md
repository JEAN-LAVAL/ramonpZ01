MiniAssessment week 6.
Datafile chosen is about High school students performance in the USA, from 'Kaggle'. It was last updated in 2018. 
The gender, race, parental
level of education, lunch, test preparation course, Math score, Reading score and Writing scores are recorded for each student.

The dataset is very neat and does not require much cleaning or reordering.

I analysed the dataset and found that there are relationships between student scores and their ethnicity, parental level of education and 
whether they did a test preparation course.

I answered all the questions in the miniassessment6.

I did visualisation and lastly created an interactive Bokeh graph stored in file 'circle.html'.

Lastly I listed some hypotheses for future work.
